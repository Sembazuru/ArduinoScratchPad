Actual output after the cut line.
The update interval is 30000ms (30.000 seconds).
The first two updates are with A0 connected to +5V
During the data collection period for the third update, the jumper from A0 to +5V was removed
The fourth update A0 is floating
During the data collection period for the fifth update, A0 is jumpered to +3.3V
The sixth and seventh updates are with A0 connected to +3.3V
